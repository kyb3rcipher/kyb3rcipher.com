I've known you for a day and you're cool

2 days: You're very funny my friend :)

3 days: You're cute

4 day: I love you (in a friendly way)

5 days: I like you a little

6 days: I am falling in love with you

7 days: What we have is magical, special you are mine and I love that

8 days: I love you and I will always take care of you, I will go to meet you when I can, I promise

9 days: I love you my prince

10 days: I love what you call me I love that you speak Milan I love you very much

11 days: Maybe today my ex is talking to me but I don't care, I only love you

12 days: I'm dying of jealousy but you told me that you only talk to me and I trust you

I really lose the number of days of thinking about you so much so I will only write every time I think something about you:

It is nice to know that you are by my side, I will marry you my child

You lied to me, you talk to more guys :cry:, why? I love you, my heart is broken and you don't even ask me for forgiveness

Milan I'm very upset you failed me!

Milan, I feel like our open relationship is just a kind of permission I give you to go out with more guys :cry:

Tell me what you love, I need to hear it I think you don't anymore

Milan, let's fix this

Lasted: I don't care about the bad things you've done I need you here, love me I won't hurt you I'll be with you always you failed me but you're still here and at least you told me you were honest, I don't know what we'll do but let's get over it together

I do not care that we do we will do it together, I promise to be with you always. Believe in me we will overcome everything together and in the future you will live with me you just have to trust me, the only thing you have to do is love me

**I LOVE YOU MILAN :(fas fa-heart):**
