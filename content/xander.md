I think everything has happened very quickly, I stop to not talk to you but I only hurt myself every time you talk to me I get happy and nervous you make me the happiest and luckiest person and the most stupid person in just a few seconds, I love you that I have never doubted it but I am also afraid of losing you. Today you called me after 1 year and I just did not know what to say, never forget me because I will never do it, I will call you in 1 week.
